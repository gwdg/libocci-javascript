# OCCI-Client in Javascript


## Requirements


You need at least

* an OCCI-Server with JSON-Rendering

## Install
There are two ways to use this client:

* You can checkout the source:

    	git clone https://github.com/gwdg/libocci-javascript.git
		
		
* Or you can download the zipfile from the [downloads](https://github.com/gwdg/libocci-javascript/zipball/master) page and unzip the file. 

## Usage

If your server supports Cross-Browser-Scripting, you can start the OCCI-Client from anywhere.
Otherwise you have to move the content into:
    
    /public/

## Functionality

The general functionality depends on the JSON-Rendering.
So far you can get all the instances of your OCCI-Server and all the details about a resource.
Support of POST-commands is in development.
